# list-item

A linear workflow for taking a single item from "I have this thing" to a ready-to-post eBay listing. One invocation = one item. Checkpoint files allow resuming mid-session.

## Style and Pricing Rules

Load these two files at the start of every session — they govern all copy and pricing decisions:

- `docs/listing-style.md` — title format, description structure, free shipping paragraph (verbatim), "Sold As Is." rule, no em-dashes, round numbers
- `docs/gear-comp-research.md` — comp analysis rules, category-specific pricing notes (comics, music gear, disc golf, electronics)

**Read both files before Phase 1.**

## Session Folders

**Location:** `docs/listing-sessions/<slug>/`
**Slug:** kebab-case item name (e.g. `elfquest-hidden-years`)

Each session folder contains:
- `checkpoint.json` — phase state, written after each completed phase
- `comps.txt` — comp data file, written automatically by the skill after API fetch
- `listing.md` — final ready-to-post output, written at Phase 8
- `photos/` — drop item photos here (jpg/png) before Phase 8; skill reads and uploads to eBay EPS at post time

On invocation: check `docs/listing-sessions/` for a folder matching the item. If `checkpoint.json` exists, skip to the first phase where `done: false`. If not found, create the folder and start at Phase 1.

You can hand-craft a checkpoint to jump ahead — populate earlier phases as `done: true` with their data and the skill picks up from the first incomplete phase.

```json
{
  "item_name": "",
  "slug": "",
  "created": "",
  "phases": {
    "intake":       { "done": false, "data": null },
    "gap_analysis": { "done": false, "data": null },
    "comp_terms":   { "done": false, "data": null },
    "comp_data":    { "done": false, "data": null },
    "pricing":      { "done": false, "data": null },
    "copy":         { "done": false, "data": null },
    "metadata":     { "done": false, "data": null },
    "listing":      { "done": false, "data": null }
  }
}
```

Write `checkpoint.json` after each completed phase.

## Phase Flow

### Phase 1 — Intake
Ask: what are you selling? Collect:
- Item name / description (what it is, condition, known details)
- Category (infer if obvious, ask if not)
- Quantity / lot size if applicable
- Anything already known about price

Create checkpoint. Proceed.

### Phase 2 — Gap Analysis
Based on intake + category, assess what you know vs. what you need:
- Shipping method norms for the category
- Typical eBay item specifics / aspects required
- Any category-specific pricing factors from `gear-comp-research.md`

If gaps exist, ask 1-2 targeted questions. Do NOT open-ended web search.

Output a brief "here's what I know, here's what I'm assuming" summary and confirm before proceeding.

> **TODO:** call `GET http://fedora.local:3000/api/ebay/aspects?category=X` to pull required item specifics automatically.

### Phase 3 — Comp Search Terms
Propose 2-3 eBay search term variants. Explain the tradeoffs (broad vs. specific). User confirms or edits.

Output: the exact search string(s) to use. Save to checkpoint. Then immediately proceed to Phase 4 — no manual step needed.

### Phase 4 — Comp Data (automated)
Run comps automatically via the local API:

**Step 1 — Search:** POST to `http://fedora.local:3000/api/comps/search` with all confirmed search terms as separate items:
```json
{
  "items": [
    { "name": "search term one", "searchQuery": "search term one", "sources": ["ebay"] },
    { "name": "search term two", "searchQuery": "search term two", "sources": ["ebay"] }
  ]
}
```
Returns `{ results: [{ name, listings: [...] }] }`.

**Step 2 — Analyze:** For each result with listings, POST to `http://fedora.local:3000/api/comps/analyze`:
```json
{ "item": { "name": "search term", "hints": {}, "listings": [...] } }
```
Returns `{ name, analysis, csv }`.

**Step 3 — Write comps.txt:** Combine all results into `docs/listing-sessions/<slug>/comps.txt` using this format for each search term:
```
COMP RESEARCH: <search term>
============================================================

<analysis paragraph>

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

<csv rows>
```

If the API is unreachable or returns an error, fall back: tell the user to go to `http://fedora.local:3000` → COMP tab → run the searches manually → copy the result into `comps.txt` → tell you when it's there. Then read the file and proceed.

Save file reference to checkpoint. Proceed to Phase 5.

### Phase 5 — Pricing
Analyze the comp CSV using `docs/gear-comp-research.md` rules. Output:
- Comp range: floor / midpoint / ceiling
- Recommended list price with rationale
- Confidence level (thin pool, stale comps, etc.)

User confirms or overrides. Save confirmed price to checkpoint.

### Phase 6 — Copy
Write using `docs/listing-style.md` rules:
- eBay title (80-char max)
- Description (story intro → specs → free shipping paragraph → "Sold As Is.")
- Condition field

Present for review. Loop on edit requests within this phase before proceeding.

### Phase 7 — Metadata
Produce the full eBay listing metadata block.

**Resolve eBay IDs from `docs/ebay-category-map.json`:**
- Read the map file
- Match the category label from intake (e.g. `"Comics > Comic Books"`) to get `ebay_category_id`
- Match the condition string (e.g. `"Very Good"`) to get the numeric condition ID from that category's `conditions` map
- If the category label isn't in the map, tell the user and ask them to add it (provide the format). Do not proceed without valid IDs.

**Save to checkpoint `metadata.data`:**
- `category` — human-readable label (e.g. `"Comics > Comic Books"`)
- `ebay_category_id` — string ID from map (e.g. `"259104"`)
- `ebay_condition_id` — string condition ID from map (e.g. `"4000"`)
- `condition` — human-readable condition label
- `price` — confirmed price (number)
- `min_offer` — floor at 75% default, round down to whole dollar
- `format` — `"Fixed Price"`
- `duration` — `"GTC"`
- `shipping` — shipping method description
- `returns` — return policy description
- `item_specifics` — key/value aspects object

**Also derive the SKU at this phase:**
- Use the slug to build a human-readable SKU: `DW-<slug>` truncated to 50 chars
- Save as `sku` in `metadata.data`

> **TODO:** validate required aspects against live eBay category data via `GET http://fedora.local:3000/api/ebay/aspects`.

### Phase 8 — Listing
Present final review: title, price, condition, key metadata, description preview.

User approves.

**Check for photos before posting:**
- Look for files in `docs/listing-sessions/<slug>/photos/` (jpg, jpeg, png)
- If the folder is empty or missing: tell the user, ask them to drop photos there and confirm before continuing. Do not post without at least one photo.
- If photos are present: read each file, base64-encode the contents, include in the payload as `{ filename, base64 }`

Write `docs/listing-sessions/<slug>/listing.md` — clean, sectioned, copy-paste ready. One fenced block per field (title, price, min offer, category, condition, duration, shipping, returns, item specifics, description, condition field).

**Then POST to `http://fedora.local:3000/api/ebay/list-item`:**

Assemble payload from checkpoint phases `copy` + `metadata`:
```json
{
  "sku":             "<metadata.sku>",
  "title":           "<copy.title>",
  "description":     "<copy.description>",
  "conditionNotes":  "<copy.condition_field>",
  "price":           "<metadata.price>",
  "minOffer":        "<metadata.min_offer>",
  "ebayCategoryId":  "<metadata.ebay_category_id>",
  "ebayConditionId": "<metadata.ebay_condition_id>",
  "categoryLabel":   "<metadata.category>",
  "aspects":         "<metadata.item_specifics>",
  "photos":          [{ "filename": "front.jpg", "base64": "<encoded>" }, ...]
}
```

On success: report the returned `listingId` and `url`. Update checkpoint `listing.data` with `{ file, listingId, url }`.

On error: show the error message and tell the user what to fix. Do not mark listing phase done until the POST succeeds.
